# 1 - Get the current day, month, year, hour, minute and timestamp from datetime module
now = datetime.now()
print(
    f"Current Date (dd/mm/yyyy): {now.day:02d}/{now.month:02d}/{now.year}\n"
    f"Current Time (hh:min): {now.hour:02d}:{now.minute:02d}\n"
    f"Timestamp: {now.timestamp()}"
)

# 2 - Format the current date using this format: "%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S")


# 3 - Today is 5 December, 2019. Change this time string to time.


# 4 - Calculate the time difference between now and new year.


# 5 - Calculate the time difference between 1 January 1970 and now.


# 6 - Think, what can you use the datetime module for? Examples:
    
    
    # Time series analysis
    
    
    # To get a timestamp of any activities in an application
    
    
    # Adding posts on a blog
